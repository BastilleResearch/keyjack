Bastille Threat Research Team Tracking Number 13
Document version: 1.0

Overview

A vulnerability has been discovered that allows encrypted keystrokes to be injected
into an AmazonBasics wireless keyboardâ€™s dongle without knowledge of the encryption key.



Affected Platforms

The following products have been tested and shown to be affected:

- AmazonBasics Wireless Keyboard
- AmazonBasics USB Dongle (USB ID 04f2:1130)



Impact

The AmazonBasics keyboard encrypts RF packets, but the implementation makes it possible 
to infer the ciphertext and inject malicious keystrokes.



Mitigation

Exploiting this vulnerability involves transmitting RF packets to AmazonBasics dongle, 
which requires physical proximity to the target computer. 



Suggested Solutions 

This vulnerability exists because the firmware on the dongle does not enforce incrementing
AES counters. In future revisions of the product, correctly implementing counter mode AES 
by requiring that subsequent counters are incremented would mitigate this vulnerability. 



Test Environment

Packet injection was tested using a nRF24LU1+ based USB dongle to transmit RF packets to 
an AmazonBasics USB dongle.
