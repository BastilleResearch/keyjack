Bastille Threat Research Team Tracking Number 13
Document version: 1.0

Overview

A vulnerability has been discovered that allows encrypted keystrokes to be injected
into a Dell KM714 keyboardâ€™s dongle without knowledge of the encryption key.



Affected Platforms

The following products have been tested and shown to be affected:

- Dell KM714 wireless keyboard
- Dell KM714 Dongle C-U0007
  - Firmware version 012.005.00028
  - USB ID 046d:c52b



Proof-of-Concept Details

Dell KM714 keyboards encrypt keyboard packets using 128-bit AES, but the implementation 
makes it possible to infer the ciphertext and inject malicious keystrokes.



Mitigation

Exploiting this vulnerability involves transmitting RF packets to a Dell KM714 USB
dongle, which requires physical proximity to the target computer. 



Suggested Solutions 

This vulnerability exists because the firmware on the dongle does not enforce incrementing
AES counters. In future revisions of the product, correctly implementing counter mode AES 
by requiring that subsequent counters are incremented would mitigate this vulnerability. 



Test Environment

Keystroke injection was tested using a nRF24LU1+ based USB dongle, transmitting to a Dell 
KM714 USB dongle.
