Bastille Threat Research Team Tracking Number 13
Document version: 1.0

Overview

A vulnerability has been discovered that allows encrypted keystrokes to be injected
into a Lenovo Ultraslim keyboardâ€™s dongle without knowledge of the encryption key.



Affected Platforms

The following products have been tested and shown to be affected:

- Lenovo Ultraslim Wireless Keyboard
- Lenovo Ultraslim Dongle (USB ID 17ef:6032)



Impact

The Lenovo Ultraslim keyboard encrypts RF packets, but the implementation makes it 
possible to infer the ciphertext and inject malicious keystrokes.



Mitigation

Exploiting this vulnerability involves transmitting RF packets to a Lenovo Ultraslim dongle, 
which requires physical proximity to the target computer. 



Suggested Solutions 

This vulnerability exists because the firmware on the dongle does not enforce incrementing
AES counters. In future revisions of the product, correctly implementing counter mode AES 
by requiring that subsequent counters are incremented would mitigate this vulnerability. 



Test Environment

Keystroke injection was tested using a nRF24LU1+ based USB dongle, transmitting to a Lenovo USB dongle.
